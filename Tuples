Tuple is a data structure element and it is  immutable and can't be changed
tup = (10,20,30)
tup[1] -- access element

Tuple and Lists are same, only the difference is elements can't be changed in tuple

Set {} -- 
>>> s = {1,5,6,8}
>>> s                  --- When you print a value, it will be a distinct and it will arrange a elements internal
{8, 1, 5, 6}

In set Index is not possible because it doesn't have any order
